Hey, I'm Nickolas. Some call me insi, others Kirk, some Nick, and so on. I'm a freshman at the University of Minnesota, Morris, in the departments of mathematics and physics.
I personally study whatever I feel for the time being. As of now, algebraic geometry, elliptic curves, and algebraic topology.
I'm doing reading and asking questions for myself in these fields, and am spending time around other mathematics students, mathematics enthusiasts, and some physics students.
